This past week I had my second exam of the semester: Finance. The exams for that class are all multiple choice, which is not my favorite type of exam, but I did well, so I'm happy with it. <br>
On Monday, it was also the first test for Algorithms, which I am TAing. Because the FoCS was conflicting with one of the section's exam, I asked the professor if we could schedule a special time for students in that section who were planning on attending the FoCS dinner. Dr Fraij accepted my request so I got to proctor that special time exam. Other than that, we met with the rest of the TAs to sort the exams by section and alphabetically, and I have to admit that it was a fun time, because we were all implementing sorting algorithms while doing it (nothing like merge sorting two already sorted piles :) ).<br>
On Wednesday, after my CV class I attended a talk with Google's CFO, Ruth Porat, who talked about some interesting topics.<br>
I also got started with my current CV projects and I think I made good progress with Hough transform to detect circles in images, pretty cool huh?<br>
On Friday I got to lead my first tour as a CS Ambassador (which I joined this semester) and it went really well. I think that doing this volunteer work is a great way of giving something back to UTCS.<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Currently I have the CV project and the OOP exam coming up, so I should take care of those.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Next week I will be working on my CV project and preparing for the first exam of this class, by going over notes and practicing with the hackerrank problems. I also plan on running, because I haven't run in over 10 days. I also bought new running shoes, so I guess that's a special motivation to run!<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
It looks like I'm repeating myself on this question every week. The style is still the same, and I like it. However, this week Prof Downing has had some issues in time-management, we couldn't cover all the material for the day within 50 minutes. I think that's my only issue with the class so far.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a javascript package called <a href=https://momentjs.com//>Momentjs</a>. I guess it might be a better tip for the people taking SWE right now, but with internship season coming closer I thought I could share. This package offers a really simple and easy way of getting access to dates and manipulating these, in multiple formats.<br>
