This past week was very intense, probably in the top 3 of the most stressing this semester. I had 2 projects due, 1 midterm and I had to proctor an exam as well. The oop project was more time consuming that the previous ones so far. We spent a good amount debugging. It's always intimidating when I finish the implementation of a project and build the whole project for the first time, because a lot of errors pop up, and make me anxious. The cv project took some time as well, and I was too busy to even try the extra credit part this time. My Marketing exam went really well, so I am happy for that, as I tend to second-guess myself a lot when dealing with multiple-choice exams.<br>Other than school, I got my team placement for the Summer on Monday, and I got my top choice so I am really excited for that, I am looking forward to my (last) internship. I also submitted my housing choice for the Summer and requested to be roommates with my pintOS partner, I think we might be working on the same team!<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I don't have anything due this week, luckily. However, my family is visiting so I want to finish the next cv and OOP project as soon as possible (before they come on Thursday will be ideal, but it won't happen). I also have to grade the algo exams (took a break from that to write this post).<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
On Monday I have an appointment to get an MRI as my knee still feels weird (want to make sure it's just a sprained MCL as the doctor said). I will start working on the last OOP project (already found a partner) early on, and also work on the cv project. On Thursday my family is coming so I assume I will get dinner with them.<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
With the semester winding down (3 weeks left, yay!), I feel like my concept of the class is already consolidated. I think I'm confident to write c++ code in an interview or job. However, I am scared to be working on a very large project and have to debug some pointer error, as it happened with Darwin.<br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is to be more organized with our tabs on our browsers. It happens to me when I work on project that opening a new tab is easier than closing one, so I end up with multiple browser windows open at the same time and many many tabs on each, so my machine slows down as a result. Some plugins such as <a href="https://downloads.tomsguide.com/OneTab,0301-62612.html">this</a> can help with managing your tabs.<br>
