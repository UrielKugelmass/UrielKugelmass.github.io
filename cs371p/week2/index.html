                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week was the first full week of normal class schedule. I attended my lectures and a couple of events and student orgs kickoffs. In addition to this, I got an early start with Collatz –after all the issues with TravisCI. I completed assignment 0 for my Computer Vision class and signed a lease for next year! <br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Right now I have a few school projects lined up (starting with Collatz) so I am first trying to tackle those. I also have to keep doing my readings and homework for non-CS classes that I’m taking this semester. Sometimes I feel like a student is like a juggler that has to manage how to stay ahead in 4-6 different classes. <br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
This upcoming week I hope to finish our first project for OOP early on so that I have time for my other classes’ projects and homework. I also want to continue with my running – I started an early morning run with two friends last week. Hopefully I will have some extra free time to enjoy with my friends or do something fun! <br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
So far I really like the class. The fact that lectures are only 50 minutes long helps a lot. Professor Downing does a great job of making sure everyone is paying attention and making the lectures super dynamic. As far as content is concerned, I feel like I am learning, I enjoyed last lecture’s distinction between pre and post-fix increment for a variable/custom-defined-object. <br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is “View in browser” plugin. I use the version for <a href=https://www.granneman.com/webdev/editors/sublime-text/set-up-sublime-text-to-preview-your-code-in-a-web-browser/>sublime</a>, but there is a <a href=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qinjia.view-in-browser>visual studio code</a> version as well and I am sure there are others for your favorite IDE also. This tool is super useful when working on front-end projects or even this class’s blog, as it shows you how your code would look on a browser without pushing it to source control. This makes debugging easier and the whole process takes less time. It is similar to gulp watch but easier to set up in my opinion. <br>
