                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you like the least about the class?</b><br>
My least favorite part about this class was by far the format of the exams. I don't think it's a good idea to have hackerrank exams in a class were most of the students are learning c++ for the first time.</br>
The way hackerrank works makes syntax errors (which are normal to happen when you just learned the language) take up a lot of time.</br>
In addition, in class we tried to do hackerrank exercises and usually 15 minutes was not enough, so it would make sense that 90 minutes for 7 of those exercises was not enough.</br>
2.  <b>What did you like the most about the class?</b><br>
There were many things that I appreciated in this class. I feel pretty comfortable in c++ now, even though I couldn't write a simple HelloWorld.c++ back in January.<br>
I think that Professor Downing does an exceptional job in making sure that students are following, and can be funny sometimes as well.<br>
3.  <b>What's the most significant thing you learned?</b><br>
What I value the most is learning c++, but learning it to a point that I can single out advantages and disadvantages of it in comparison to Java, and maybe even decide that one or the other is best for a given project.<br>
4.  <b>How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?</b><br>
That would vary from week to week depending on when the assignments were due, on average I would say 6.<br>
5.  <b>How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?</b><br>
I will be honest, I did not buy the book, and I barely read the free chapters online. However, I enjoyed the articles that were linked on the website, and I read them every week so probably 1 hour or so.<br>
I now follow Joel Spolsky on Twitter, I really like his articles.<br>
  6.  <b>How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</b><br>
  In total? that's a hard question ... I would say in the order of thousands counting hackerrank exercises and projects.<br>
  7.  <b>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</b><br>
  I appreciate having learned how to use Travis CI. Although it might have been 'overkill' for the types of projects we did, Continuous Integration is used everywhere, so I value that.<br>
  8.  <b>If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</b><br>
  I would definitely change the format of the exams, or give more time for them, not everyone is fast at coding, and Syntax Errors can take some time. I think there are more effective ways of assessing students' grasp of the material.<br>
