                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week I had my first exam of the semester: Marketing. The exams for that class are all multiple choice, which is not my favorite type of exam, but I did well, so I'm happy with it. <br>My week had a rough start because my throat was hurting and I thought I was getting sick, so when I went to the grocery store I stocked on orange juice and tea to overcome that.<br>On Wednesday, Ethan and I worked on the final touches for the voting project (documentation, comments and unit tests) and we submitted it.<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
On Monday I have my first Finance test, so I expect to be studying for that tomorrow. I also received the e-mail from the company that I'll be interning at this Summer asking for my interests to finalize my team, so I'll be answering that this weekend as well.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I expect next week to be busy. I need to make new plans for Spring Break because my old plans fell through. I also want to get an early start with the next Computer Vision project. Since we don't have an assignment coming up for OOP, I expect to spend more time on other homework. <br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I think that at this point of the semester I already got used to the style. Even though the quizes have gotten more complicated recently, Prof. Downing clearly explains the answers right after so it is a good learning experience. Coding on hackerrank is also good practice for the exam.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a mobile app called <a href=https://apolloapp.io//>Apollo</a>. I refused to join reddit in the past because I thought that their UI was bad (which I still believe). However, after coming across this app, I gave it a try. Apollo is a Reddit app that improves the User Interface and makes it easier to read content on mobile. Apollo also brings some optimizations to the table, so the content usually loads faster as well. TechCrunch said that "Apollo is the only Reddit app you need.", so why don't you give it a try?<br>
