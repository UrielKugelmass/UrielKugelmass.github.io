This past week was relatively easy as far as school work goes. Ayberk and I finished with Allocator pretty early so this week we just ran the tools and turned it in. Outside of school I played some IM soccer playoffs games (won on Monday, lost on Wednesday and also got injured), and coached the other IM team I'm on on Thursday because of my knee.<br>
I wish I managed my time better this week and had started my CV project early.<br>
I also sold my registration to the longhorn run to my friend's girlfriend because the doctor said I shouldn't run for another month or so :( <br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I have a Finance exam on Monday, so I want to study accordingly for that. I have to do some grading as well and want to get started with CV as soon as I can, as that class's projects tend to be complicated.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
After my test on Monday I hope to focus on CV and get that done as soon as possible. I am also going out of town on Thursday or Friday for passover, so I am happy for that.<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
The class is fine, I keep learning, some quizzes are pretty complicated, the hackerrank exercises are not too bad, especially since we can work with a partner on them. I wish we had a little bit more time to solve the hackerrank exercises in class.<br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a tool/shortcut for iterm. I reccommended iterm instead of the regular terminal (for MacOS users) a while ago. Today I want to reccommend <a href=https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-hotkey.html/>hotkeys</a>. You can customize whatever key commands you want and iterm will pop-up immediately. It is an easy and quick way to get the terminal running by pressing 1-2 keys instead of doing cmd-space + "iterm" + return. It also opens up faster and in a smooth way.<br>
