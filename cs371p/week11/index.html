                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week was exhausting. As far as school goes, I only had one test (Monday morning), so not too bad. However, I worked a decent amount on my cv project and my partner and I got started and worked a bit on Darwin. On Wednesday, we had the Israel Block Party on campus so I spent that entire day at the event pretty much (left the event to go to Finance and OOP lectures). Nonetheless, we had to start 2 hours later because of the lightning. That day I woke up at 5 am to help with the set up, so I was really tired by the end. On Friday I went out of town for Passover so I had to skip OOP lecture.<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I have a tough week ahead. Monday is the algo test so I have to proctor one of the tests. Tuesday I have my cv project due. Wednesday I am taking a test for one of my online classes. Thursday Darwin is due. And Friday I expect to be doing a lot of grading for the algo test.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I expect to be pretty busy next week with all the work detailed above. Since it is passover I can't have leavened bread so figuring out what to eat can be a challenge. I want to cook my meals so that I know 100% what goes in them.<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I like how prof. Downing explains the topics by showing examples on his laptop and asking students guided-questions. I feel that by carrying out this approach, he makes sure that everybody is following, and can help people understand better, because not everyone likes asking questions if not being asked.<br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is pretty simple: read books. It is an easy way to get your mind out of school-related stuff but at the same time you are also learning -not necessarily CS-related subjects. I started reading a new book this week and so far I love it. Don't want to post the title of it until I finish it, so be patient for that.<br>
