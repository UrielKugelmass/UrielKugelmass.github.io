                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week I was mostly busy working on my Computer Vision project. For that class, we are using matlab, and although the assignment was not too complicated, I created a bug because of my inexperience with Matlab and figuring that out took me some time. Outside of classes, I played some soccer (IM season started), read a little bit and only ran once, but at least I ran at a very good pace!<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I don't have a lot on my way. This morning I worked with my partner for the OOP voting project and we got all the tests passing, so we took some pressure off our shoulders. We still need to optimize our solution, add some tests and do work on setting up the tools, but that shouldn't take too long. I need to study for my Marketing class, since we have our first test on Tuesday.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
This upcoming week I will finish the voting project (hopefully early on). I will study for my Marketing exam (which is on Tuesday), and play my weekly IM soccer games. I expect to have plenty of free time, so maybe I will get an early start on my Computer Vision project and go to the gym. I plan on finishing my book this weekend and starting a new one. Last semester I bought a bunch of books that I want to read but haven't found enough time yet. <br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I like this class a lot. Learning about the intricacies of c++ and comparing it with other more familiar languages such as Java, Python and C helps a lot. I think I understood the concept of l-values vs r-values and I am adopting the pre-increment for my code, so I think I am putting into practice what we have been learning in class.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a plugin called <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noisli/klejemegaoblahjdpcajmpcnjjmkmkkf?hl=en-US/>Noisli</a>. Sometimes it happens to me that I am working in the GDC or in a public space, and some people are having conversations close to me. This makes it really hard for me to focus on my work so I need a way to isolate my mind from what's going on next to me. I used to plug in my headphones and play music, but the songs' lyrics were also a distraction. But then I tried Noisli, which is a tool that lets you build your own "combos". These are combinations of natural sounds (rain, fire, thunderstorms, etc) that can be relaxing and help me be more productive.<br>
