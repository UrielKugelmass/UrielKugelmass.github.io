This past week could have been divided into two halves, which were really different for me. From Monday until Wednesday it was just a normal week, I went to classes and did some homework/studying at home. On Thursday, we had our first OOP exam, so I prepared accordingly.</br>
However, the most intense was definitely Friday. As I said last week, we had to turn in our Computer Vision assignment (Hough transform, color and texture based segmentation), so I spent ~7 hours on Friday finishing up with the last details and also doing the write-up (which took a long time).</br>
I have a mixed feeling towards that class: On the one hand, I think that the material is really interesting, but when it comes to the assignments, coding in MATLAB makes me upset over and over again.</br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I need to study and prepare for my CV and Marketing exams, I will have my first back-to-back exams in my college career, I am excited!<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Next week I will be studying hard for Computer Vision and also review Marketing, I hope I can have some free time to run and work out as well, I couldn't do that last week.<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I like this class, we had our first test on Thursday, it was my first experience taking a test on my laptop. We didn't cover too much this week since Wednesday was almost all review and we didn't have class on Friday.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a framework to manage how the shell looks. It is really helpful when working on projects and making use of git. <a href=https://gist.github.com/ZenLulz/c812f70fc86ebdbb189d9fb82f98197e/>Here is a link to the github repo</a>. oh-my-zsh makes the terminal look super cool and professional. Highly recommend it.<br>
