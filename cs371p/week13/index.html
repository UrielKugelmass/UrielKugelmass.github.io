I didn't have any exams this week. I tried to focus on getting ahead in Life (the project) and my Computer Vision project because my family came in on Thursday and I've been spending a decent amount of time with them since then.<br>
I also got all my paperwork ready for my internship so I am very happy for that.<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I am currently working on my computer vision project (writing this blog post is one of my breaks from it). Running the code can take a decent amount of time, and I still have to implement parts of it.<br>
The reports for the projects require some thought, and to be honest, the project page (usually) doesn't provide a lot of information on what to or not to include on the report. <br>
My partner and I still have to finish Life, our schedules have not been the best lately.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I hope to be done with the computer vision project by Monday night (I am sure it won't happen, but let's keep it this way). The earlier I finish that project, the more time I will have to focus on the OOP project<br>
I don't know what to expect in OOP this week since prof. Downing won't be there. I guess we'll have a break from tremendously hard quizes (Friday 4/13 cough).<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I appreciate the fact that I learned a new language from scratch throughout the semester. c++ may be useful in my career at some point. Prof. Downing made sure that we learned about some intricacies of the language, and he also made sure to keep Java (most of the student's first OO language) in comparison.<br>
I think I said this in some other post, but having to debug some pointer error in an industry-level project just brings me headaches. I have no idea how I would deal with that.
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is to not procrastinate. I told myself I was going to do a lot of work last weekend but I didn't do as much and now my family is here and I cannot spend that much time with them because I have to work on projects. I feel bad because they flew so many hours to spend time with me, but school is always important to me (and to them as well).<br>
