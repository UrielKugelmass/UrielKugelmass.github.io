This past week was probably the most stressing week I've had in a while in terms of school work.<br>
I had two back-to-back midterms for my first time, and that was pretty draining. On Thursday I had a Marketing and a Computer Vision tests (at 2pm and 3:30pm respectively). I planned accordingly and started studying ahead of time for Computer Vision (which has a lot of content, and much of it is not so simple to grasp).<br>
Apart from this, I managed to go on two runs, on Tuesday and Thursday. I am still running 4 miles only (I am training for the 10k longhorn run), but I am feeling more comfortable with my pace and endurance. Unluckily, on my Thursday run (after my two tests), Strava, the app I use to track my pace, had some problem and didn't record the distance well.<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
With Spring Break this week, I don't have too much to worry about. Hopefully, Ayberk and I will finish the allocator assignment before Monday when we re-start with school, so that I can spend time on other assignments during that week.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will be going to Big Bend with two friends. Since this is my first time hiking, I am really excited and looking forward to it. Today we are going to do some grocery-shopping, as we will be camping and need to bring our own food and supplies. We rented a tent from Gregory gym and one of my friends gave me her sleeping bag. We will be back on Friday, so I will probably do some school work next weekend (Allocator assignment especially).<br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
With the first test already behind us, I feel like the content started to get more interesting. I enjoyed learning about how c++ manages the heap. I also liked what Prof. Downing said about making use of T* const pter so that when we call delete[] nothing bad or unexpected happens. <br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a follow-up from my tip of last week. Last week I mentioned "oh-my-zsh". This week, I want to recommend installing plugins for it. <a href=https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/>Check them out here</a>. I personally use git, osx, web-search, zsh-autosuggestions, sublime and thefuck. You can see a more detailed description for each of these in the link I provided. They will make your life easier!!<br>
