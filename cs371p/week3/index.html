This past week I was mostly busy working on Collatz. Although I thought it was not going to take too much time because of all the discussion we had in class, not testing my code enough made me struggle and spend more than I anticipated trying to figure out why my code was not passing all the tests. In addition to this, I did some work for my Computer Vision class and managed to have free time to go for some runs (Sunday night, Tuesday morning and Thursday night). Finally, I spent some time setting up all the tools that we were required for the assignment, and I guess that's positive because: 1- I learned and it will be easier for next time 2- I had a good time in the gdc at lab hours.<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Not too much. On my first entry in the blog I said that I had to decide where to live next year and make plans for Spring break. I signed a lease two weeks ago, and last week I decided I will be going on a roadtrip with some friends! So at this point I'm only worried about academics, so trying to finish my Computer Vision project before Friday and finish grading for Algo. <br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
This upcoming week I hope to finish my Computer Vision project. On the non-academic side, I hope to keep running, hopefully I can start running longer distances and also go to the gym a couple times. Hopefully I will have enough free time to call my family during the week as well, it's hard to be disconnected from them for a couple days. <br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
I still have the same opinion of this class. I enjoy it a lot, professor Downing is very engaging, and we've been learning stuff that I found particularly interesting. I wish I had been doing better on the quizes, but I guess it is part of the learning experience as well. Doing hackerrank problems in class is helpful because it allows us to work in groups (get to know classmates) and also try to solve problems that could be similar to what's going to be on the test.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a plugin called <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cageify/ppoobnoipkllpmpnnldhpghefjhiinoh?hl=en/>Cageify</a>. Last Summer, during my internship, it was fairly common to "prank" people if they left their cubicles for a couple minutes to go to the restroom for example. On my first week, I made the mistake of leaving my laptop unlocked and it took me some days to realize that Chrome was replacing all pictures on the browser with images of Nicolas Cage. The tip here is not so much to make people upset but rather to make sure we lock our machines whether at work or at school or anywhere we are to keep our work and lives private in case someone takes our stuff.<br>
