I also want to get familiar with the class style, as I want to take Software Engineering in the Fall, and I was told that the class style is similar.<br>

In Austin I survived the “terrible” weather conditions that we had and attended my classes.

However, I was surprised by the Socratic method that Prof. Downing uses in class. I think it is one of the most effective ways to keep the students’ attention that I’ve seen so far.

I strongly recommend using <a href=”https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html”>"iterm2”</a> instead of the built-in terminal that macOS offers. Why? Super simple to split-panes (useful when multi-tasking), prettier overall and also easy to customize it. <a href=https://www.slant.co/versus/1713/1715/~iterm2_vs_terminal-app>here</a> is a detailed list of reasons why “iterm2” is a better option.
