This past week was the busiest for me so far this semester. We had our first SWE test on Monday so I spent some time on Monday preparing for it. On Thursday I had my second Number Theory test and my first Data Mining test, I am pretty sure I did better on Data Mining. We also started with the new phase of the SWE project, I am a little bit worried about having to crunch a lot of the work on the last week, but we seem to be making some progress. We populated the database with our articles already, and we’re meeting in an hour to make more progress on the project.<br>


2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Not much, I am taking it easy on my last year, I guess. I have to plan what classes to take next semester (my last one as a student), I only need a CD flag and 2 UD CS electives, as well as English. I will probably do American Literature which has the CD flag (any recommendations for professors?) and then 3 CS electives, maybe one of them pass/fail.  
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
My dad is visiting this week, so I will be spending a lot of time with him. I will try to get most of my work for the week out of the way today-tomorrow so that I can enjoy my time with him. 
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of Test #1 (the problems, the time, HackerRank)?</b><br>
I had a better experience on the test than what I remember from OOP. My main complaint when I took OOP was that the format of hackerrank meant that each syntax error would “run down the clock” considerably, which played against me – I had 0 experience with C++ before taking OOP. For SWE, however, we have been using Python, which is less verbose and more simple in terms of syntax, so it’s easier for people that just learned the language to write code that actually compiles.
<br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a follow-up from my tip of last week. Last week I mentioned "oh-my-zsh". This week, I want to recommend installing plugins for it. <a href=https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/>Check them out here</a>. I personally use git, osx, web-search, zsh-autosuggestions, sublime and thefuck. You can see a more detailed description for each of these in the link I provided. They will make your life easier!!<br>
