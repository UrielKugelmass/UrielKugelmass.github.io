                                                                                This past week I was pretty busy. I had some IM games so I spent a lot of time at the fields, I also had an assignment due for Data Mining so I spent a good amount of time doing my work for that class. For the past couple assignments in that class, I worked by myself since my schedule has been a little bit hectic and I didn’t want to bother someone else with it. <br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Right now I have to figure some stuff out related to paperwork for my Full-Time job. As an international student, there are some extra steps I need to take to make sure everything is in place so that I can legally work when I graduate. The problem is that in the Spring I will be travelling home for my brother’s wedding and that may cause issues with this process. I reached out to the international office at the end of last week and hopefully they can solve this.<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will be working with my SWE group finishing up our project, we did a good amount of work today, the backend is pretty much done, but we need to make some touches on the frontend. As a member of the select frontend relievepoverty.me team, I want to make sure that our website looks as clean as possible. Sometimes it’s hard when we argue with the backend folks who do not appreciate the importance of misaligned components and non-symmetric margins.<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience in learning SQL? </b><br>
I knew a little bit of SQL from my data management class, but I haven’t used it in a while, so I appreciated re-learning the concepts. My favorite part of this section was when we took a break and learned about regular expressions – we actually used some regular expressions today on our styles.css file to solve a problem we encountered.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is to be more organized with our tabs on our browsers. It happens to me when I work on projects that opening a new tab is easier than closing one, so I end up with multiple browser windows open at the same time and many many tabs on each, so my machine slows down as a result. Some plugins such as <a href="https://downloads.tomsguide.com/OneTab,0301-62612.html">this</a> can help with managing your tabs.<br>
