This past week was a little bit special. On Wednesday it was Yom Kippur – The Jewish atonement day, which I explained in my last week’s post. For this holiday, we have to fast for 25 hours – no food or drinking allowed, so had to prepare accordingly. I started hydrating a few days in advance so that I would be ready for those tough hours, however, my main issue is always with food. I usually have low blood sugar so the last 4-5 hours of the fast were not easy for me. Luckily I could finish it and treated myself to some Queso from Kerbey Lane!<br>
Apart from this I did regular schoolwork, worked out and practiced a little bit for my upcoming onsite interview. Took my first test of the semester and hanged out with some friends.
<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I am planning on going to Europe for Winter break, and I have to buy the flight tickets soon. I know that the prices may go up so I have to be proactive and tackle that very soon. I also need to plan that out so I know what I will be doing when. I have heard of a site called couchsurfing.com or something like that which lets you connect with locals and stay for free, so I will investigate more on that. 
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I have a test on Tuesday so I will be studying for that today/tomorrow. I have to finish an assignment for data mining today so will also be doing that. Tonight I have my first IM soccer game of the season (yay!) and throughout the week I am planning on having some free time to practice for my interview and read the book I just started.
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)? </b><br>
The problem itself is not hard. There are some difficulties with optimizations and tricks to the question (having the two numbers in reverse order), but that’s about it. The overkill requirements were a pain; I will be honest with that. I am excited to get started with the bigger project and start working with my team.
<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a plugin called <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noisli/klejemegaoblahjdpcajmpcnjjmkmkkf?hl=en-US/>Noisli</a>. Sometimes it happens to me that I am working in the GDC or in a public space, and some people are having conversations close to me. This makes it really hard for me to focus on my work so I need a way to isolate my mind from what's going on next to me. I used to plug in my headphones and play music, but the songs' lyrics were also a distraction. But then I tried Noisli, which is a tool that lets you build your own "combos". These are combinations of natural sounds (rain, fire, thunderstorms, etc) that can be relaxing and help me be more productive.<br>
