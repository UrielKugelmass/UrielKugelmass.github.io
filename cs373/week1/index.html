                                                                                        This past week I was spending some time with family and friends at home. I went home for 2 weeks after my internship ended before heading to UT for my Senior year (yay!). Flying back to Austin took some time, 26 hours overall including layovers to be exact. Surprisingly, I wasn't too tired by the time I arrived. Having only a 2-hour difference is also a blessing, dealing with jet lag would be a pain especially during the first few weeks of school.
                                                                                        <br>
                                                                                        <b>-What's in your way?</b>
                                                                                        <br>
                                                                                        Since I decided to fly back to the U.S. a little bit later, I missed all of my classes on the first week. This means that I will need to catch up in all of these classes, which can be challenging for some of them since not all professors use Canvas or Piazza to post the Syllabus and required materials.
                                                                                        <br>

                                                                                        <br>
                                                                                        As I said before, I will try to catch up early on this week, so that I have time to start on the projects for my classes. Other than that, I will probably hang out with people I haven't seen all Summer. Finally, I will probably do some meal prep since I love cooking and I plan on eating healthy this year.
                                                                                        <br>

                                                                                        <br>
                                                                                        As far as lectures are concerned, I expect something very similar to what I experienced in OOP, which I took last semester. I wanted to take this class to learn more about best practices in Software Engineering while working on the project. I also enjoyed Downing's lecture style last semester, so decided this class would be a good bet.
                                                                                        <br>

                                                                                        <br>

I strongly recommend using <a href=https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html>"iterm2”</a> instead of the built-in terminal that macOS offers. Why? Super simple to split-panes (useful when multi-tasking), prettier overall and also easy to customize it. <a href=https://www.slant.co/versus/1713/1715/~iterm2_vs_terminal-app>here</a> is a detailed list of reasons why “iterm2” is a better option.
