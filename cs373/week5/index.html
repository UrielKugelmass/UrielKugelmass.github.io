This past week I spent some time doing school work. I had a math test on Tuesday so I got ready for that during the weekend, also finished up my Data Mining assignment. I also played my first couple IM games of the year, it’s good to be back on the fields – last time I played IM last Spring I got injured (Sprained MCL) so that was not fun. We discussed our topic with our team for SWE, spent a lot of time on it to be honest, and finally on our second try we got it approved. We met again for a few hours and got a lot of the initial set-up and first tasks tackled. We will be meeting tomorrow again to finish up what we have left for p1.
<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I have an onsite interview on Friday so I will be missing lecture for that, I guess it could have been worse if it was yesterday and I had to miss two quizzes. I will make sure to go over what we cover on class before I get back on Monday. I booked my flights for Winter break, so I am excited for that, I am travelling to Europe to meet some family and spend time with friends – I guess this is out of my way now.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will meet up with my SWE team to finish up p1, prepare for my interview and read for my classes. Hopefully I will have time to exercise as well, I went for a run this morning after a long time . I usually do meal prep, but I don’t know if I will do that this week.
<br>
4.  <b>What's your experience of the readings, so far? And, if you went, what did you think of the talk by Under Armour? (this question will vary, week to week)
</b><br>
Some of the readings are the same as the ones I read for OOP last semester, so not a lot to say on that regard. I think they ones about Software Engineering are more useful and can be applicable to our projects. We also had a talk with Under Armour last semester, but I enjoyed yesterday’s way more. I really liked hearing from an experienced Director about all the possible paths one can take in the industry.
<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a mobile app called <a href=https://apolloapp.io//>Apollo</a>. I refused to join reddit in the past because I thought that their UI was bad (which I still believe). However, after coming across this app, I gave it a try. Apollo is a Reddit app that improves the User Interface and makes it easier to read content on mobile. Apollo also brings some optimizations to the table, so the content usually loads faster as well. TechCrunch said that "Apollo is the only Reddit app you need.", so why don't you give it a try?<br>
