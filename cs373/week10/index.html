Last week I spent a good chunk of it finalizing our work for this class’s project. I wrote the acceptance tests and also made some final touches to the front end. I also had a few IM games, and now we’re headed to playoffs. I also started on a side-project, and I am trying to balance the time that I spend on that end with the time I spend doing actual schoolwork. It is hard to stop doing something you care about to start working on schoolwork.
<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I still need to book some flights and train tickets for my trip to Europe over Winter break. With exams and projects due for all my classes it is very hard to also deal with that, but I feel like the break is approaching very fast.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
This week will be very busy for me. I don’t have that much work for my classes, however, I do want to get started with the next stage of the project for this class. I have a lot of IM games this week, and I’m also attending a conference on AI that is happening Tuesday-Wednesday in Austin. 
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of Project #3?</b><br>
Project #3 gave me the chance to learn a lot about react. I went over some tutorials and we managed to do the transition without much pain. I learned about routing, even though I was not the lead person on that task, I learned about shared components and also brushed up on my styling skills.<br> 
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is pretty simple: read books. It is an easy way to get your mind out of school-related stuff but at the same time you are also learning -not necessarily CS-related subjects. Personally, I enjoy non-fiction books more because I feel like it’s more applicable to life experiences. The last book I finished was Sapiens, by Yuval Noah Harari. Now I am reading Homo Deus by the same author.<br>
