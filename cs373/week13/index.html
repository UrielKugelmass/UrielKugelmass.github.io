This past week was pretty busy, because I was travelling to Miami for a conference on Thursday, I had to make sure I had all my work done for the rest of the week/weekend. Luckily, that did happen and the conference was a success. 
<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I don’t have that many things left in the semester. To be honest, I only have the presentation and test for SWE, and then another project and 3 finals, not a huge deal but I will need to study a lot for all that, I guess. As a senior I find myself not as stressed out at this point of the semester. I am also flying to Europe for the break and meeting with some friends from back home over there, so I am very excited about it. 
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Tomorrow and on Tuesday we will be meeting up with our SWE group to finalize the presentation and our developers’ visualizations. After doing our own visualizations it shouldn’t be as hard. However, I didn’t enjoy d3, to be honest… A lot of it seemed like “black magic” and copying some code found online. I like it better when I understand what I am doing.
<br>
4.  <b>If you went, what did you think of the talk by Google?</b><br>
I was not in town last Friday.<br>
5. <b> What was your experience of the refactoring topics?</b> <br>
This may have been one of my favorite aspects of the class. I am actually taking Software Design next semester, and one of the main reasons is because I want to become better at refactoring – and I heard you learn a lot about that in that class. I will be pursuing a career in Software Development (at least for the foreseeable future), and being able to clean up existing code and make it more readable is an invaluable skill.
<br>
6.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is an app called f.lux, which I have been using for years now. It simply manages the dominant colors in the screen (macOS, no idea if this app exists for any other OS) and I have it set up so that after 10 pm it turns yellowish, so that I don’t have bright colors on my face right before bed. I think it is important to take care of our eyes’ health, especially when we are constantly in front of our laptops in this field.
