-   This past week I was busy with school work and interview prep. I finished my Data Mining assignment on Sunday so that was mostly out of the way. We got together with our SWE group on Sunday for a good amount and tackled a good chunk of the tasks for Project #2 so we knew what to do to get our website ready before the deadline. I spent some time reading for my Business Law class since we have a test coming up, but it’s hard to read all those Litigation cases. I flew out for my interview on Thursday and as I am writing this I am waiting for my flight back to Austin at the gate.<br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
-   Now with interview season behind me, the only thing that’s on my way is Senior year and my laziness about it. I find it hard to motivate myself, I realized I don’t care as much as I did before. This is good because I don’t stress as much and I guess I can “enjoy” my time left in school, but it is also really bad because it may affect my GPA.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
-   I will be reading a lot for my Business Law class since we have a test on Thursday, probably get an early start on the next step for the SWE project and the same with my Data Mining assignment. I also have an IM game on Wednesday and I will work out as well.
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of Project #2?</b><br>
-   I liked this project, I was looking forward to starting the large project and meeting with my group. Honestly, I am excited because when we meet up with the group, apart from getting the work done, we have a good time, and we get along pretty well. I learned a little bit about AWS and refreshed on some HTML and CSS that I had forgotten.
<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
-   My tip of the week is a javascript package called <a href=https://momentjs.com//>Momentjs</a>. This package offers a really simple and easy way of getting access to dates and manipulating these, in multiple formats.<br>
