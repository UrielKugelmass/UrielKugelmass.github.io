This past week I had two mid-terms, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. Therefore, I spent a good amount of my time preparing for these. Luckily, my team and I had most of our work done in time before our deadline on Tuesday for this class, so we didn’t have to worry too much about it. Outside of school, I played some soccer, made it to the finals for my 7v7 men’s team. We will be playing the final game after thanksgiving. 
<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
With most of the mid-terms out of my way, the only thing left before the break is over is my procrastination with planning for my trip over winter break. We still need to do some reservations and the break is coming pretty fast, so will need to get that done ASAP.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
This upcoming week is pretty chill in terms of school work, since we have thanksgiving break. My mom is visiting so I will spend time with her, and will be going to Houston to spend thanksgiving with some friends. I am excited because it will be my mom’s first thanksgiving dinner, and I wonder if she’ll like it. I hope I can finalize all my reservations for winter break so that I can focus on projects and the rest of the semester after the break.
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of Project #4?</b><br>
Project #4 was a good time. As I have been saying throughout this semester, my team and I had a great time and bonded a lot every time we met to work on the project. On a more technical note, I keep learning stuff about React, and I am becoming better (and more picky, I guess) at doing front-end work.<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is jupyter notebooks. It is an easy and simple way to write and execute some Python. If you're working on some data science project or anything python related, it is an easy way to write and execute your code on the same environment. It is also practical for small scripts.<br>
