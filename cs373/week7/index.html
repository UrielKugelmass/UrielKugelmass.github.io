This past week I had my Business Law test, so I prepared for it (did a ton of reading). I also worked on my Data Mining project, which is due tonight, but I already finished it. I played soccer for my IM team, and I made a terrible decision that got me limping for some days, hopefully I get better soon. Finally, I signed my Full Time offer on Friday, so I am very excited for that.
</br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I have to do some planning with my friends for our Winter Break trip. I am meeting two friends from Uruguay that are studying abroad in France and we have to decide where to go to book flights and do some research on how to get free (or very cheap) lodging. With 3 tests next week I don’t know how much I can do about it.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
I will be spending most of my time preparing for the tests that are coming up and doing some schoolwork as well. Hopefully I can manage my time to do some of my personal reading too, I haven’t had enough time recently to do that. I also plan on getting some work done for project 3 and learning more about React.
<br>
4.  <b>What was your experience of learning the basics of Python? </b><br>
I enjoyed learning about Python, I think it is a great tool to get small scripts done and carrying out interviews. I actually used it for my last interviews, since it is so much less verbose than Java it is better for a time-constrained environment such as an interview. I think one of my favorite features is list comprehensions, with one line of code one can generate something that would take multiple lines in Java.
<br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a framework to manage how the shell looks. It is really helpful when working on projects and making use of git. <a href=https://gist.github.com/ZenLulz/c812f70fc86ebdbb189d9fb82f98197e/>Here is a link to the github repo</a>. oh-my-zsh makes the terminal look super cool and professional. Highly recommend it.<br>
