                                                                                This past week I did regular schoolwork, worked out and did a coding challenge. On Monday I went to services and dinner because of the Jewish New Year “Rosh Hashana” – we start 5779, feeling old right?. <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah>Here</a>’s a link to learn more about the holiday.

<br>                                                                                2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
I don’t have anything on my way, per se. I guess the only thing that’s playing against me is laziness and lack of motivation (I guess that’s expected since I am a Senior?). I understand that I need to start working harder, hopefully I will get the motivation to do it soon, all this rain has been terrible motivation btw.
<br> 3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Next week will be busy. Tuesday night till Wednesday night is Yom Kippur – “The repentance” day in the Jewish calendar, so I will be fasting for 25 hours (No food, no water). <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yom_kippur>Here</a>’s a link to learn more about the holiday. Other than that I have to study for a Business Law quiz, which accounts for 25% of the total grade, have to do some homework for other classes and start practicing for my onsite interview. 
<br> 4.  <b>What's your experience of the in-class exercises?</b><br>
So far I think we’ve done only one of those. It wasn’t too complicated, so there’s not too much to talk about it. From my experience with OOP, the questions for the test will be of similar nature so going back to these exercises will be a great practice for the test!
<br>  5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is not a tool or framework. It is more of a concept that I have seen in the workplace but unfortunately I never had a professor that mentioned it in a class. “Impostor syndrome” happens a lot in the field of Software Engineering, and it is the feeling when one believes he/she is not qualified for his/her job. It can have serious consequences, and today I encountered an article discussing it <a href= https://jaxenter.com/impostor-syndrome-survey-149402.html>here</a>. I think it is very important that we all know about such a concept as it may affect us in the near future, or even our colleagues and friends.
