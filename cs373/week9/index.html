                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you do this past week?</b><br>
This past week I spent a good amount of it with my team working on the project for this class. I focused more on React stuff and I am glad because I feel like I learned a lot and it may be useful in the future when I go into the “real world”. My dad was also visiting so I spent some time with him, being so far away from home means that I don’t get to see my family that often, so I try to make the most out of my time with them when they come here.
<br>

2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
Not a whole lot at this point. I don’t have midterms for like a month or so, but still need to get projects done. I am registering for classes (for the last time) on Wednesday, and I need to finalize my courses for that. I think I will be taking 3 CS electives, but the way the system works is that it doesn’t let you register for the 3 classes at once, so I will need to make a plan for that.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
Next week I will keep doing work for this class, probably do my Data Mining assignment and go on some runs if the weather is as nice as it is today (and yesterday). I also want to get back to my workout routine, last week was pretty busy so I didn’t really go to the gym.
<br>
4.  <b>What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?</b><br>
I was very surprised when I showed up to class and saw them, they were my professors for my UGS (my first lecture in college was with them) and I have great memories from them (I even spent thanksgiving at their house!). On the specifics of the talk, I think that it is a great idea that Prof. Downing is going out of his way to discuss ethics in the Software world. We will all be dealing with very sensitive information once we go work in the industry, and it is very important that we know how to handle this data.
<br> 
5. <b>If you went, what did you think of the talk by Atlassian?</b><br>
I was at the talk. I liked it, but to be fair, I preferred Under Armour’s. It was nice to hear from an experienced Enginner (Or developer, I guess) and how the industry has changed over the years.
<br>
6.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is a tool/shortcut for iterm. I reccommended iterm instead of the regular terminal (for MacOS users) a while ago. Today I want to recommend <a href=https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-hotkey.html/>hotkeys</a>. You can customize whatever key commands you want and iterm will pop-up immediately. It is an easy and quick way to get the terminal running by pressing 1-2 keys instead of doing cmd-space + "iterm" + return. It also opens up faster and in a smooth way.<br>
