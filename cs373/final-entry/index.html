                                                                        <p>1.   <b>What did you like the least about the class?</b><br>
Since I took OOP last semester with Prof. Downing, I knew what to expect from this class. The lectures are pretty similar, so nothing to be surprised about.</br>
However, as with the final exam last semester, I found one of the questions catching me off guard, and I guess this is my least favorite part of the class. I found it unfair that we got asked to implement the decorator taking in a function, since we didn't have much experience with problems like that before.<br>
2.  <b>What did you like the most about the class?</b><br>
My favorite part of the class was by far the semester-long project. I was lucky enough to get a good group and not only was everyone invested in the class and did their fair amount of work, but we also managed to have a good time every time we met up.<br>
3.  <b>What's the most significant thing you learned?</b><br>
I think the most significant thing I learned was ReactJS. I can definitely see myself using that in my career in the next few years (before some new tool comes up that is a lot better).<br>
I had some experience using Angular from a past internship, so I appreciated learning about React as they tend to be the most widely used, and now I feel like I am more "well-rounded" as a developer.<br>
4. <b>How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?</b><br>
This is a hard question, because it varied from week to week. Some weeks I did as little as 0 hours, and some other weeks I worked over 25 hours.<br> 
5. <b>How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?</b><br>
I am going to be real honest in here. I didn't spend much on the readings. I do find Joel Spolsky's articles to be very interesting, but I read all those last semester when I was taking OOP.<br>  
6.  <b>How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</b><br>
  In total? that's a hard question ... I would say in the order of thousands counting acceptance and unit tests, as well as React code.<br>
  7.  <b>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</b><br>
        As I said before, I think React is the most important thing I got from this class. It is pretty robust in terms of how many things you can do, like Routing to name the feature that I liked the most.<br>
  8. <b>What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</b><br>
        For testing, we used enzyme, which was not required. We found that this was the most efficient way to test our React components - from our Research and what other classmates were saying on their weekly blogposts.<br>                                                                        
  9.  <b>If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</b><br>
  I already said this on my ECIS survey, but I think that being able to completely pick the topic for the website would be big plus. I understand Prof. Downing's good intentions in getting us to do a 'good to society', however, in reality not much is actually done by having a website that links 3 datasets.<br>
  Maybe actually give extra credit for those that go out of their ways to do some volunteer work? But I don't think that showing society's problems on a website that will probably die in the next week or so helps much.<br>
