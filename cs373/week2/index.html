This past week was essentially my first week of school as I was out of town until last Friday. I basically just went to all my classes, worked out a good amount (I hope I can keep this going throughout the semester, when I get busier) and also did some homework. I didn’t get to catch up with as many people as I wished, partly because I moved to North Campus and most of my friends are in West Campus, but I guess that’s a consequence of my decision to move neighborhoods for my Senior year. Last night I went to the NRG Stadium to watch a friendly soccer game between Mexico and Uruguay. It was a great time, being so close to the players that I watch on TV every weekend was an awesome experience, I wish they were friendlier and got closer to the stands so that we could take some selfies with them at the end. 
 <br>
2.  <b>What's in your way?</b><br>
 I have a few assignments due at the beginning of next week, one of them is already finished, but since I am in Houston for the weekend, I am not sure how much I will get done in here. I also have to complete a coding challenge before Wednesday, but I want to do it when I am back in Austin, probably Monday or Tuesday. I am interviewing with a couple other companies before my deadline is due to accept/decline my FT offer, I hope to get to the point where I have that problem of having to decide between a few places where I would love to work.
<br>
3.  <b>What will you do next week?</b><br>
At the beginning of the week I will tackle my Data Mining assignment and do the coding challenge I have to do, then probably start working on the assignment for this class. Since I took OOP last semester and we did the same assignment in C++ I don’t expect this one to take that long to complete. Other than that, I want to play some pick up soccer (I couldn’t play this week because of the rain) and catch up with some friends.
 <br>
4.  <b>What's my experience of the class?</b><br>
So far my experience is similar to what I expected. Prof. Downing leads the class in the same way as he does for OOP, so I can’t snooze or I will get called and humiliated for not paying attention  Talking about Collatz again wasn’t too exciting because I already heard all that 6 months ago in OOP.
 <br>
5.  <b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b><br>
My tip of the week is “View in browser” plugin. I use the version for <a href=https://www.granneman.com/webdev/editors/sublime-text/set-up-sublime-text-to-preview-your-code-in-a-web-browser/>sublime</a>, but there is a <a href=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qinjia.view-in-browser>visual studio code</a> version as well and I am sure there are others for your favorite IDE also. This tool is super useful when working on front-end projects or even this class’s blog, as it shows you how your code would look on a browser without pushing it to source control. This makes debugging easier and the whole process takes less time. It is similar to gulp watch but easier to set up in my opinion. <br>
