                                                                                In addition, I would only continue working at this company until I can find a new job, and I would immediately start actively looking 
                                                                                for new opportunities after something like this happens. The scenario that is stated in here is a direct violation of the employee's privacy, or at least an intent
                                                                                to do so, by the owner of this organization. This goes against some of the most important values that I look in a company that I am working for.<br>
                                                                                In a similar scenario, where the person asking me to violate someone's privacy was my manager, but not the owner or president of the company, I would go to my manager's manager
                                                                                and tell this person about the situation I just encountered.<br>

                                                                                of the authors of these suggestions, and then asking a developer to reveal the identity of the saboteour, the company is failing on its honesty with the employees, one of the most valuable -if not the most valuable
                                                                                assets in the company.<br>

The employee would have probably said something different had she or he 
                                                                                known that her or his anonymity was not going to be respected.  
                                                                                Although this is only one decision at a given time, it represents the ideas of the president of the company, that is, the person that has the final say in most of the long-term and strategic decisions made for this
                                                                                company that I am a part of. In a way, these are the company's values. <br>So far in my internship experience I have had, privacy has always been at the top of the list, and it's been always respected.<br>
                                                                                I do believe, however, that employees' anonymity should be left aside if the subject matter being analyzed involves sensitive customer information. A lot of companies deal with user information that has to be kept private 
                                                                                - examples include medical records, credit card information and others. I think that if a company knows that some employee has been using its access to this private information for undesired reasons, the company can investigate 
                                                                                and figure out the identity of the employee (and take some sort of action in response). This is a different case, however, in which sensitive customer information is exposed, and there was no promise on the employer's side to keep
                                                                                employees' anonymity.<br>
                                                                                I believe that any other course of action - asking for more details such as what made this employee write such a negative feedback would imply accepting that a violation of the employee's privacy is not a wrongful act.
